# ðŸ§ª Cypress Automated Testing Project â€” SauceDemo Practice

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This project contains **end-to-end automated tests** for the [SauceDemo website](https://www.saucedemo.com/) built using **Cypress**.  
It follows **industry-standard QA practices** and **ISTQB principles**, focusing on maintainability, reusability, and readability.

The suite uses **fixture-based data-driven testing**, **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, and **custom Cypress commands** to simulate real user behavior and validate key functionalities like product addition, cart validation, and checkout flow.
